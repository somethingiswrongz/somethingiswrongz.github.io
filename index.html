            <h2>Verb + object + <strong>to</strong> + infinitive</h2>
            <h4>After certain verbs</h4>
            <p>We can use the following verbs + object + <strong>to</strong> + infinitive: <strong>advise, allow, ask, beg, cause, convince, enable, encourage, expect, force, get</strong> (see <a href="https://test-english.com/grammar-points/b2/get/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">get uses</a>),<strong> help, intend, invite, mean, order, persuade, recommend, remind, take </strong>(time)<strong>, teach, tell, warn. </strong>(See table with examples below)</p>

            <p>We can also use <strong>want, need, would like, would hate, would prefer</strong> + object + <strong>to</strong> + infinitive.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><em>I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>need you to do</strong></span> something for me.</em></li>
            <li><em>She <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>wants me to go</strong></span> to the doctor with her.</em></li>
            <li><em>They <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>would like me to be</strong></span> available at all times. </em></li>
            <li><em>I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>would hate you to think</strong> </span>I didn&#8217;t appreciate what you did for me. </em></li>
            <li><em>I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>would prefer you</strong></span> to be quiet</em></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Verbs also used in other ways</h4>
            <p><span class="highlighter">Advise, persuade, remind, teach, tell, warn</span></p>
            <p>We can also use <strong>advise, persuade, remind, teach, tell, warn</strong> + object + <strong>(that)</strong> clause.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><em>Our mentor has <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>advised us that</strong></span> we should start working on the project as soon as possible.</em></li>
            <li><em>The president <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>persuaded them that</strong></span> the situation was critical. </em></li>

            </ul>
            <p><span class="highlighter">Recommend</span></p>
            <p>We can also use <strong>recommend</strong> + <strong>that</strong> clause (without object).</p>

            <li><em>I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>recommended (that he stays</strong> </span>.</em>(less formal)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="highlighter">Advise, allow, recommend</span></p>
            <p>We can use <strong>advise, allow, recommend </strong> + object + <strong>to</strong> + infinitive. But if they are followed by the verb (without the object), this verb must take the <strong>-ing</strong> form.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><em>He advised <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>me to go</strong></span></em>, but <em>He advised<span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong> going</strong></span></em>.</li>
            <li><em>They don&#8217;t allow <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>us to drink</strong></span> anything</em>, but <em>They don&#8217;t allow <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>drinking</strong></span>. </em></li>

            <h2>Verb + <strong>for someone</strong> + <strong>to</strong> + infinitive</h2>
            <p><span class="highlighter">Arrange, ask, plan, wait</span></p>

            <ul>
            <li><em>It was a <strong><span style="color: #ec6825;">mistake for you to lend</span></strong> him the money.</em></li>
            <li><em>It would be a <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>disaster for the company to reduce</strong></span> the number of staff.</em></li>
            <li><em>I think it&#8217;s a good <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>idea for him to go</strong></span> to the interview.</em></li>

            </ul>
            <p><span class="highlighter">Too/enough</span></p>
            <p>We can also use <strong>too</strong> or <strong>enough</strong> + <strong>for someone</strong> + <strong>to</strong> infinitive.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><em>The book was <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>too great for me to forget</strong></span>.</em></li>
            <li><em>It was <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>warm enough for us to sit</strong></span> in the open.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="highlighter">Infinitive of purpose</span></p>
            <p>We can also use the same structure after an infinitive of purpose.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><em>The purpose of this activity is <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>for the students to practice</strong></span> their listening skills.</em></li>
            <li><em>The goal is <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>for the dog to relax</strong></span> when wearing a leash. </em></li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Verb + object + infinitive without <strong>to</strong></h2>
            <h4>Let, make, help</h4>
            <p>We can use the verbs <strong>let</strong>, <strong>make</strong>, and <strong>help </strong>followed by object + infinitive without <strong>to</strong>.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><em>She drives me to work and never <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>lets me pay</strong></span> for the petrol. </em></li>
            <li><em>The teacher <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>made us write</strong></span> a very long essay. </em></li>
            <li><em>Can I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>help you fix</strong></span> the fence?</em>  (But <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>help somebody to do</strong></span> is also correct)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="highlighter">Be made to do</span></p>
            <p>We say <strong>make </strong>+ someone + infinitive (without <strong>to</strong>), but we say someone + <strong>be</strong> <strong>made</strong> + <strong>to</strong> + infinitive.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><em>They <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>made the staff wear</strong></span> their uniform every day.</em></li>
            <li><em>The staff <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>were made to wear</strong></span> their uniform every day.</em></li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Hear, listen, notice, see</h4>
            <p>We can use <strong> hear, listen, notice, see</strong> + object + infinitive without <strong>to</strong> to talk about a short or complete action (see <a href="https://test-english.com/grammar-points/b1-b2/gerund-or-infinitive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">B1+ verb patterns</a>):</p>
            <ul>
            <li><em>I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>saw</strong></span> them <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>kiss</strong></span></em> (I saw the action from start to end. It was probably a short kiss.)</li>
            <li><em>I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>heard</strong></span> someone <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>shout</strong></span> your name.</em> (I heard the shouting from start to end.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span class="highlighter">But</span> we use <strong>hear, listen, notice, see, watch</strong> + object + <strong>-ing</strong> to talk about an action in progress; an action that is longer and incomplete.</p>
            <ul>
            <li><em>I <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>saw</strong></span> them <span style="color: #ec6825;"><strong>kissing</strong></span> in the park.</em> (The action was in progress. I didn’t see it finish.)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h2>Verb + object + gerund</h2>
            <p>In this kind of construction, the object of the main verb is the subject of the verb in the gerund form. The following verbs can be used before object + gerund: <strong>dislike, hate, imagine, involve, keep, mind, prevent, not like, remember, resent, risk, stop </strong>(See table with examples below)<br />
